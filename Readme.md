# **AI Code Generator - Powered by Gemini**  

The **AI Code Generator** is an advanced coding assistant built using **Google's Gemini AI**. This project is designed to generate accurate and efficient code snippets based on user requirements. By leveraging the power of **Google Generative AI**, the system understands natural language prompts and responds with high-quality, executable code in multiple programming languages.

## **Key Features**
- **Gemini-Powered AI**: Uses Google's **Gemini-1.5-Flash** model to generate intelligent and context-aware code responses.  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Generates code in various programming languages such as **Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more** based on user input.  
- **Flask API Integration**: The backend is structured using **Flask**, allowing users to make API requests and fetch code dynamically.  
- **Automatic Error Handling**: Handles incorrect inputs and provides meaningful error messages.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and responsive UI that enables users to enter prompts and receive code outputs seamlessly.  

## **How It Works**
1. The user enters a coding-related prompt (e.g., *"Write a Flask API for fetching user stats."*).  
2. The system processes the request and formulates an AI-generated response.  
3. The AI model ensures the response is **structured as a valid JSON** containing the generated code.  
4. The output is displayed on the UI, allowing users to **copy, use, and modify** the generated code as needed.  

## **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js 
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini API  
- **Hosting**: Github Pages  

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Authentication System**: Allowing users to save generated code.  
- **Code Execution**: Integrating an in-browser code execution feature.  
- **Version Control**: Keeping track of previous code generations for easy access.  
- **API Deployment**: Exposing the AI model as an API for developers.  

This AI-powered tool simplifies coding by generating high-quality solutions in seconds, making it a valuable asset for developers, learners, and professionals. ðŸš€
